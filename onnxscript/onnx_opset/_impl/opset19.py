         AveragePool consumes an input tensor X and applies average pooling across
         the tensor according to kernel sizes, stride sizes, and pad lengths.
         average pooling consisting of computing the average on all values of a
         subset of the input tensor according to the kernel size and downsampling the
         data into the output tensor Y for further processing. The output spatial shape will be following:
         ```
         output_spatial_shape[i] = floor((input_spatial_shape[i] + pad_shape[i] - ((kernel_spatial_shape[i] - 1) * dilations[i] + 1)) / strides_spatial_shape[i] + 1)
         ```
         or
         ```
         output_spatial_shape[i] = ceil((input_spatial_shape[i] + pad_shape[i] - ((kernel_spatial_shape[i] - 1) * dilations[i] + 1)) / strides_spatial_shape[i] + 1)
         ```
         if ceil_mode is enabled `pad_shape[i]` is the sum of pads along axis `i`.

         `auto_pad` is a DEPRECATED attribute. If you are using them currently, the output spatial shape will be following:
         ```
         VALID: output_spatial_shape[i] = ceil((input_spatial_shape[i] - ((kernel_spatial_shape[i] - 1) * dilations[i] + 1) + 1) / strides_spatial_shape[i])
         SAME_UPPER or SAME_LOWER: output_spatial_shape[i] = ceil(input_spatial_shape[i] / strides_spatial_shape[i])
         ```
         And pad shape will be following if `SAME_UPPER` or `SAME_LOWER`:
         ```
         pad_shape[i] = (output_spatial_shape[i] - 1) * strides_spatial_shape[i] + ((kernel_spatial_shape[i] - 1) * dilations[i] + 1) - input_spatial_shape[i]
         ```
         The output of each pooling window is divided by the number of elements (exclude pad when attribute count_include_pad is zero).


        Args:
            X: (differentiable) Input data tensor from the previous operator; dimensions
                for image case are (N x C x H x W), where N is the batch size, C is the
                number of channels, and H and W are the height and the width of the
                data. For non image case, the dimensions are in the form of (N x C x D1
                x D2 ... Dn), where N is the batch size. Optionally, if dimension
                denotation is in effect, the operation expects the input data tensor to
                arrive with the dimension denotation of [DATA_BATCH, DATA_CHANNEL,
                DATA_FEATURE, DATA_FEATURE ...].

            auto_pad: auto_pad must be either NOTSET, SAME_UPPER, SAME_LOWER or VALID.
                Where default value is NOTSET, which means explicit padding is used.
                SAME_UPPER or SAME_LOWER mean pad the input so that `output_shape[i] =
                ceil(input_shape[i] / strides[i])` for each axis `i`. The padding is
                split between the two sides equally or almost equally (depending on
                whether it is even or odd). In case the padding is an odd number, the
                extra padding is added at the end for SAME_UPPER and at the beginning
                for SAME_LOWER.

            ceil_mode: Whether to use ceil or floor (default) to compute the output
                shape.

            count_include_pad: Whether include pad pixels when calculating values for
                the edges. Default is 0, doesn't count include pad.

            dilations: Dilation value along each spatial axis of filter. If not present,
                the dilation defaults to 1 along each spatial axis.

            kernel_shape: The size of the kernel along each axis.

            pads: Padding for the beginning and ending along each spatial axis, it can
                take any value greater than or equal to 0. The value represent the
                number of pixels added to the beginning and end part of the
                corresponding axis. `pads` format should be as follow [x1_begin,
                x2_begin...x1_end, x2_end,...], where xi_begin the number of pixels
                added at the beginning of axis `i` and xi_end, the number of pixels
                added at the end of axis `i`. This attribute cannot be used
                simultaneously with auto_pad attribute. If not present, the padding
                defaults to 0 along start and end of each spatial axis.

            strides: Stride along each spatial axis. If not present, the stride defaults
                to 1 along each spatial axis.

        r"""[🌐 Cast(19)](https://onnx.ai/onnx/operators/onnx__Cast.html#cast-19 "Online Documentation")


        The operator casts the elements of a given input tensor to a data type
        specified by the 'to' argument and returns an output tensor of the same size in
        the converted type. The 'to' argument must be one of the data types specified
        in the 'DataType' enum field in the TensorProto message.

        Casting from string tensor in plain (e.g., "3.14" and "1000") and scientific numeric representations
        (e.g., "1e-5" and "1E8") to float types is supported. For example, converting string "100.5" to an integer may
        yield result 100. There are some string literals reserved for special floating-point values;
        "+INF" (and "INF"), "-INF", and "NaN" are positive infinity, negative infinity, and not-a-number, respectively.
        Any string which can exactly match "+INF" in a case-insensitive way would be mapped to positive infinite. Similarly,
        this case-insensitive rule is applied to "INF" and "NaN". When casting from numeric tensors
        to string tensors, plain floating-point representation (such as "314.15926") would be used.
        Converting non-numerical-literal string such as "Hello World!" is an undefined behavior. Cases
        of converting string representing floating-point arithmetic value, such as "2.718", to INT is an undefined behavior.

        Conversion from a numerical type to any numerical type is always allowed.
        User must be aware of precision loss and value change caused by range difference between two types.
        For example, a 64-bit float 3.1415926459 may be round to a 32-bit float 3.141592. Similarly, converting
        an integer 36 to Boolean may produce 1 because we truncate bits which can't be stored in the targeted type.

        In more detail, the conversion among numerical types should follow these rules
        if the destination type is not a float 8 type.

        * Casting from floating point to:
          * floating point: +/- infinity if OOR (out of range).
          * fixed point: undefined if OOR.
          * bool: +/- 0.0 to False; all else to True.
        * Casting from fixed point to:
          * floating point: +/- infinity if OOR. (+ infinity in the case of uint)
          * fixed point: when OOR, discard higher bits and reinterpret (with respect to two's complement representation for
            signed types). For example, 200 (int16) -> -56 (int8).
          * bool: zero to False; nonzero to True.
        * Casting from bool to:
          * floating point: `{1.0, 0.0}`.
          * fixed point: `{1, 0}`.
          * bool: no change.

        Float 8 type were introduced to speed up the training of
        deep models. By default the conversion of a float *x* obeys
        to the following rules. `[x]` means the value rounded to
        the target mantissa width.

        | x | E4M3FN | E4M3FNUZ | E5M2 | E5M2FNUZ |
        |------|----|----|----|----|
        | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
        |-0 | -0 | 0 | -0 | 0 |
        | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
        | +/- Inf | +/- FLT_MAX | NaN | FLT_MAX | NaN |
        | [x] > FLT_MAX | FLT_MAX | FLT_MAX | FLT_MAX | FLT_MAX |
        | [x] < -FLT_MAX | -FLT_MAX | -FLT_MAX | -FLT_MAX | -FLT_MAX |
        | else | RNE | RNE | RNE | RNE |

        The behavior changes if the parameter 'saturate' is set to False.
        The rules then become:

        | x | E4M3FN | E4M3FNUZ | E5M2 | E5M2FNUZ |
        |------|----|----|----|----|
        | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
        |-0 | -0 | 0 | -0 | 0 |
        | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN | NaN |
        | +/- Inf | NaN | NaN | +/- Inf | NaN |
        | [x] > FLT_MAX | NaN | NaN | Inf | NaN |
        | [x] < -FLT_MAX | NaN | NaN | -Inf | NaN |
        | else | RNE | RNE | RNE | RNE |

            W: Weight tensor that will be used in the convolutions. It has shape (oC,
                C/group, kH, kW), where oC is the number of output channels and kH and
                kW are the kernel height and width. For more than 2 dimensions, it has
                shape (oC, C/group, k1, k2, ... , kn).

            offset: Offset tensor denoting the offset for the sampling locations in the
                convolution kernel. It has shape (N, offset_group * kH * kW * 2, oH, oW)
                for 2D data or (N, offset_group * k1 * k2 * ... * kn * n, o1, o2, ... ,
                on) for nD data. Use linear interpolationfor fractional offset values.
                Sampling locations outside of the padded input tensor gives zero.

            B: (optional) Optional 1D bias of length oC to be added to the convolution.
                Default is a tensor of zeros.

            mask: (optional) The mask tensor to be applied to each position in the
                convolution kernel. It has shape (N, offset_group * kH * kW, oH, oW) for
                2D data or (N, offset_group * k1 * k2 * ... * kn * n, o1, o2, ... , on)
                for nD data. Default is a tensor of ones.

            dilations: Dilation value along each spatial axis of the kernel. Default is
                1 along each axis.

            group: Number of groups the input and output channels, C and oC, are divided
                into. C and oC must both be divisible by group. Default is 1.

            kernel_shape: Shape of the convolution kernel. If not present, it is
                inferred from the shape of input W.

            offset_group: Number of groups of offset. C must be divisible by
                offset_group. Default is 1.

            pads: Padding for the beginning and end along each spatial axis. The values
                represent the number of pixels added to the beginning and end of the
                corresponding axis and can take any nonnegative value. The format should
                be as follows: [x1_begin, x2_begin, ..., x1_end, x2_end, ...], where
                xi_begin is the number of pixels added at the beginning of axis `i` and
                xi_end is the number of pixels added at the end of axis `i`. Default is
                0 along each axis.

            strides: Stride along each spatial axis. Default is 1 along each axis.

        The linear dequantization operator. It consumes a quantized tensor, a scale, and a zero point to compute the full precision tensor.
        The dequantization formula is `y = (x - x_zero_point) * x_scale`. `x_scale` and `x_zero_point` must have same shape, and can be either a scalar
        for per-tensor / per layer quantization, or a 1-D tensor for per-axis quantization.
        `x_zero_point` and `x` must have same type. `x` and `y` must have same shape. In the case of dequantizing int32,
        there's no zero point (zero point is supposed to be 0).
        `zero-point` is usually not used in the case of float8e4m3fn, float8e4m3fnuz, float8e5m2, float8e5m2fnuz quantization,
        but the dequantization formula remains the same for consistency and 'x_scale' still determines the output type.


        Args:
            x: N-D quantized input tensor to be de-quantized.

            x_scale: Scale for input 'x'. It can be a scalar, which means a
                per-tensor/layer dequantization, or a 1-D tensor for per-axis
                dequantization.

            x_zero_point: (optional) Zero point for input 'x'. Shape must match x_scale.
                It's optional. Zero point is 0 when it's not specified.

            axis: (Optional) The axis of the dequantizing dimension of the input tensor.
                Ignored for per-tensor quantization. Negative value means counting
                dimensions from the back. Accepted range is [-r, r-1] where r =
                rank(input).

              // b_out; user_defined_vals; keepgoing_out;
            }

        There are several things of note in this code snippet:

        1) Values from the enclosing scope (i.e. variable "a" here) are in scope and can
           be referenced in the inputs of the loop.
        2) Any values computed in the loop body that needs to be used in a subsequent
           iteration or after the loop are modelled using a pair of variables in the loop-body,
           consisting of an input variable (eg., b_in) and an output variable (eg., b_out).
           These are referred to as loop-carried dependences. The loop operation node
           supplies the input value of the input variable for the first iteration, and
           returns the output value of the output variable produced by the final
           iteration.
        3) Scan_output variables are used to implicitly concatenate values computed across
           all the iterations. In the above example, the value of user_defined_val computed
           over all iterations are concatenated and returned as the value of user_defined_vals
           after the loop.
        4) Values created in the body cannot be accessed in the enclosing scope,
           except using the mechanism described above.

        Note that the semantics of this op support "diagonal" or "wavefront" execution.
        (See Step 3 here for an example:
        https://devblogs.nvidia.com/optimizing-recurrent-neural-networks-cudnn-5/).
        Frontends should emit multi-layer RNNs as a series of While operators (with
        time being the inner looping dimension), with each successive layer consuming
        the scan_outputs from the previous layer, possibly going through several
        point-wise operators (e.g. dropout, residual connections, linear layer).

        The input/output of subgraph (produced by loop node) matching is based on order instead of name. The implementation will figure out the names based on this order.

        The linear quantization operator. It consumes a high precision tensor, a scale, and a zero point to compute the low precision / quantized tensor.
        The scale factor and zero point must have same shape, and can be either a scalar for per-tensor / per layer quantization, or a 1-D tensor for per-axis quantization.
        The quantization formula is `y = saturate ((x / y_scale) + y_zero_point)`.
        For saturation, it saturates to [0, 255] if it's uint8, or [-128, 127] if it's int8.
        For (x / y_scale), it's rounding to the nearest even. Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding for details.
        'y_zero_point' and 'y' must have same type.
        'y_zero_point' is usually not used for quantization to float8e4m3fn, float8e4m3fnuz, float8e5m2, float8e5m2fnuz,
        but the quantization formula remains the same for consistency and
        the type of the attribute 'y_zero_point' still determines the quantization type.

                quantization.

            y_zero_point: (optional) Zero point for doing quantization to get 'y'. Shape
                must match y_scale. Default is uint8 with zero point of 0 if it's not
                specified.

            axis: (Optional) The axis of the quantization dimension of the input tensor.
                Ignored for per-tensor quantization. Negative value means counting
                dimensions from the back. Accepted range is [-r, r-1] where r =

        if input \"sizes\" is not specified.


        Args:
            X: (differentiable) N-D tensor

            roi: (optional, non-differentiable) 1-D tensor given as [start1, ...,
                startN, end1, ..., endN], where N is the rank of X or the length of
                axes, if provided. The RoIs' coordinates are normalized in the
                coordinate system of the input image. It only takes effect when
                coordinate_transformation_mode is "tf_crop_and_resize"

            scales: (optional, non-differentiable) The scale array along each dimension.
                It takes value greater than 0. If it's less than 1, it's sampling down,
                otherwise, it's upsampling. The number of elements of 'scales' should be
                the same as the rank of input 'X' or the length of 'axes', if provided.
                One of 'scales' and 'sizes' MUST be specified and it is an error if both
                are specified. If 'sizes' is needed, the user can use an empty string as
                the name of 'scales' in this operator's input list.

            sizes: (optional, non-differentiable) Target size of the output tensor. Its
                interpretation depends on the 'keep_aspect_ratio_policy' value.The
                number of elements of 'sizes' should be the same as the rank of input
                'X', or the length of 'axes', if provided. Only one of 'scales' and
                'sizes' can be specified.

            antialias: If set to 1, "linear" and "cubic" interpolation modes will use an
                antialiasing filter when downscaling. Antialiasing is achieved by
                stretching the resampling filter by a factor max(1, 1 / scale), which
                means that when downsampling, more input pixels contribute to an output
                pixel.

            axes: If provided, it specifies a subset of axes that 'roi', 'scales' and
                'sizes' refer to. If not provided, all axes are assumed [0, 1, ...,
                r-1], where r = rank(data). Non-specified dimensions are interpreted as
                non-resizable. Negative value means counting dimensions from the back.
                Accepted range is [-r, r-1], where r = rank(data). Behavior is undefined
                if an axis is repeated.

            coordinate_transformation_mode:
        This attribute describes how to transform
                the coordinate in the resized tensor to the coordinate in the original
                tensor.

        The coordinate of each dimension is transformed individually.
                Let's describe a case using axis x as an example.
        Denote `x_resized` as
                the coordinate of axis x in the resized tensor,
         `x_original` as the
                coordinate of axis x in the original tensor,
         `length_original` as the
                length of the original tensor in axis x,
         `length_resized` as the length
                of the resized tensor in axis x,
         `scale = length_resized /
                length_original`,
         `output_width` the target length on the axis x which
                can be a fractional number when it is calculated out of a scale factor,
                and `output_width_int` the effective output width as an integer.

        if
                coordinate_transformation_mode is `"half_pixel"`,
        ```
        x_original =
                (x_resized + 0.5) / scale - 0.5
        ```

        if coordinate_transformation_mode
                is `"half_pixel_symmetric"`,
        ```
        adjustment = output_width_int /
                output_width
        center = input_width / 2
        offset = center * (1 - adjustment)
                x_ori = offset + (x + 0.5) / scale - 0.5
        ```

        if
                coordinate_transformation_mode is `"pytorch_half_pixel"`,
        ```
        x_original
                = length_resized > 1 ? (x_resized + 0.5) / scale - 0.5 : 0
        ```

        if
                coordinate_transformation_mode is `"align_corners"`,
        ```
        x_original =
                x_resized * (length_original - 1) / (length_resized - 1)
        ```

        if
                coordinate_transformation_mode is `"asymmetric"`,
        ```
        x_original =
                x_resized / scale
        ```

        if coordinate_transformation_mode is
                `"tf_crop_and_resize"`,
        ```
        x_original = length_resized > 1 ? start_x *
                (length_original - 1) + x_resized * (end_x - start_x) * (length_original
                - 1) / (length_resized - 1) : 0.5 * (start_x + end_x) * (length_original
                - 1)
        ```
        .

            cubic_coeff_a: The coefficient 'a' used in cubic interpolation. Two common
                choice are -0.5 (in some cases of TensorFlow) and -0.75 (in PyTorch).
                Check out Equation (4) in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1163711
                for the details. This attribute is valid only if mode is "cubic".

            exclude_outside: If set to 1, the weight of sampling locations outside the
                tensor will be set to 0 and the weight will be renormalized so that
                their sum is 1.0. The default value is 0.

            extrapolation_value: When coordinate_transformation_mode is
                "tf_crop_and_resize" and x_original is outside the range [0,
                length_original - 1], this value is used as the corresponding output
                value. Default is 0.0f.

            keep_aspect_ratio_policy:
        This attribute describes how to interpret the
                `sizes` input with regard to keeping the original aspect ratio of the
                input, and it is not applicable when
        the `scales` input is used.

        Given
                a set of `sizes`, associated with a subset of `axes` (explicitly
                provided or default), and assuming `d = axes[i]`, with `i` being the
                index of the provided `sizes`.

        If `keep_aspect_ratio_policy` is
                `"stretch"`, the original aspect ratio is disregarded, and the input is
                resized to the specified size:
        `out_size[d] = sizes[i]`

        If
                `keep_aspect_ratio_policy` is `"not_larger"`, the sizes are adjusted so
                that no extent of the output is larger than the specified size, while
                keeping the original aspect ratio:
        ```
        scale = Min(sizes[i] /
                in_size[d])
        out_size[d] = round_int(scale * in_size[i])
        ```

        If
                `keep_aspect_ratio_policy` is `"not_smaller"`, the sizes are adjusted so
                that no extent of the output is smaller than the specified size, while
                keeping the original aspect ratio:
        ```
        scale = Max(sizes[i] /
                in_size[d])
        out_size[d] = round_int(scale * in_size[i])
        ```

        For
                non-resizable axes (those not specified in `axes`), the output size will
                be equal to the input size.

        Note: `round_int` stands for computing the
                nearest integer value, rounding halfway cases up.

            mode: Three interpolation modes: "nearest" (default), "linear" and "cubic".
                The "linear" mode includes linear interpolation for 1D tensor and
                N-linear interpolation for N-D tensor (for example, bilinear
                interpolation for 2D tensor). The "cubic" mode includes cubic
                interpolation for 1D tensor and N-cubic interpolation for N-D tensor
                (for example, bicubic interpolation for 2D tensor).

            nearest_mode: Four modes: "round_prefer_floor" (default, as known as round
                half down), "round_prefer_ceil" (as known as round half up), "floor",
                "ceil". Only used by nearest interpolation. It indicates how to get
                "nearest" pixel in input tensor from x_original, so this attribute is
                valid only if "mode" is "nearest".

        Scan can be used to iterate over one or more scan_input tensors,
        constructing zero or more scan_output tensors. It combines ideas from general recurrences,
        functional programming constructs such as scan, fold, map, and zip, and is intended to enable
        generalizations of RNN-like constructs for sequence-to-sequence processing.
        Other tensors (referred to as state_variables here) can be used to carry a state
        when iterating from one element to another (similar to hidden-state in RNNs, also referred
        to as loop-carried dependences in the context of loops).
        Many common usages involve a single scan_input tensor (where functionality
        similar to scan, fold and map can be obtained). When more than one scan_input is used,
        a behavior similar to zip is obtained.

        The attribute body must be a graph, specifying the computation to be performed in
        every iteration. It takes as input the current values of the state_variables and
        the current iterated element of the scan_inputs. It must return the (updated) values
        of the state_variables and zero or more scan_output_element tensors. The values of the
        scan_output_element tensors are concatenated over all the iterations to produce the
        scan_output values of the scan construct (similar to the concatenated intermediate
        hidden-state values of RNN-like constructs). All the output tensors (state_variables as
        well as scan_output_element tensors) are required to have the same shape in each iteration
        of the loop (a restriction imposed to enable efficient memory allocation).

        Note that the iterated element passed to the body subgraph does not have a sequence
        axis. It will have a rank one less than the rank of the corresponding scan_input.

        The scan operation returns the final values of the state_variables as well as the
        scan_outputs.

        The optional attribute scan_input_directions specifies the direction (forward or backward)
        for each scan input. If this attribute is omitted, all sequences are scanned in the forward
        direction. A bidirectional scan may be performed by specifying the same tensor input twice
        in the scan_inputs, once with a forward direction, and once with a backward direction.

        The scan_output of the operation is produced by concatenating the scan_output_element
        values produced by the body in each iteration.  The optional attribute scan_output_directions
        specifies the direction in which scan_output is constructed (by appending or prepending the
        scan_output_element to scan_output in each iteration) for each scan_output. If this attribute
        is omitted, the scan_output_element is appended to the scan_output in each iteration.

        The optional attribute scan_input_axes specifies the axis to be scanned for each scan_input.
        If omitted, every scan_input will be scanned in axis 0. For example, if axis 0 is the
        batch axis and axis 1 is the time axis (to be scanned), specify an axis value of 1.
        Note that scanning a non-zero axis may be less efficient than scanning axis zero.

        The optional attribute scan_output_axes specifies the axis along which the scan_outputs
        are accumulated for each scan_output. For example, if axis 1 is the time axis (to be
        scanned) for both inputs and outputs, specify a scan_input axis and scan_output axis
        value of 1.

        Note that because of the ONNX restriction that only the last parameter of an operator can
        be variadic, the initial-states and scan-inputs are listed together as one input parameter.
        Similarly, the final-states and scan-outputs are listed together as one output parameter.
        The attribute num_scan_inputs indicates the number M of scan-inputs.

        The behavior of

            Scan <
                num_scan_inputs = m,
                body = loop-body,
                scan_input_axes = [axis_1, ..., axis_m]
            > (init_1, ..., init_n, scan_1, ..., scan_m)

        is equivalent to the following pseudo-code:

            // scan_i.shape[axis_i] denotes the (max) sequence-length of scan_i
            // scan_i.shape[axis_i] is required to be equal to scan_j.shape[axis_j] for all i,j.
            sequence_length = scan_1.shape[axis_1];

            // initialize state-variables
            st_1 = init_1; ... st_n = init_n;
            // initialize scan-output variables: [] denotes an empty tensor
            scan_out_1 = []; ...; scan_out_k = [];
            // identify number of iterations:

            // execute loop
            for (int t = 0; t < sequence_length; ++t) {
                // generate the scan-input elements: the notation T<axis=k>[t] indicates the sub-tensor
                // of rank one less than T obtained by indexing T at position t along axis k.
                si_1 = scan_1<axis=axis_1>[t];
                ... ;
                si_m = scan_m<axis=axis_m>[t];
                // execute loop-body
                st_1, ..., st_n, so_1, ..., so_k = loop-body(st_1, ..., st_n, si_1, ..., si_m)
                // accumulate the scan-output elements
                scan_out_1 = Concat<axis=0>(scan_out_1, so_1); ... ; scan_out_k = Concat<axis=0>(scan_out_k, so_k);
            }

            return st_1, ..., st_n, scan_out_1, ..., scan_out_k;

        *Sample usage: Encoding RNN using a Scan*

        The following example shows how a simple RNN over an input tensor %X, with weight tensor %Wi,
        recurrence weight tensor %Ri, bias tensors %Wbi and %Rbi, and initial hidden-state %H_0 can
        be encoded as a ScanLoop. Note that the loop-body is a nested graph, and it directly computes
        %Wi, %Ri, %Wbi, and %Rbi (typically constants or initializers in the body graph). If these
        values are computed in the outer graph, they need to be passed in as extra state_variables.

            graph rnn-encoding {
              %H_0 = ...
              %X = ...
              %Y_h, %Y = Scan[body = <graph rnn-cell-1>, num_scan_inputs=1](%H_0, %X)
              return %Y, %Y_h
            }

            graph rnn-cell-1 (
              %H_tminus1[FLOAT, tensor]
              %X_t[FLOAT, tensor]
            ) {
              %Wi = ...
              %Ri = ...
              %Wbi = ...
              %Rbi = ...
              %t1 = X_t * (Wi^T)
              %t2 = H_tminus1*(Ri^T)
              %t3 = Add(%t1, %t2)
              %t4 = Add(%t3, %Wbi)
              %t5 = Add(%t4, %Rbi)
              %Ht = Tanh(%t5)
              %Accumulate = Identity(%Ht)
              return %Ht, %Accumulate
            }



        Args:
            initial_state_and_scan_inputs: (variadic, heterogeneous) Initial values of
                the loop's N state variables followed by M scan_inputs

            body: The graph run each iteration. It has N+M inputs: (loop state
                variables..., scan_input_elts...). It has N+K outputs: (loop state
                variables..., scan_output_elts...). Each scan_output is created by
                concatenating the value of the specified scan_output_elt value at the
                end of each iteration of the loop. It is an error if the dimensions of
                these values change across loop iterations.

            num_scan_inputs: An attribute specifying the number of scan_inputs M.

            scan_input_axes: An optional list of M flags. The i-th element of the list
                specifies the axis to be scanned (the sequence axis) for the i-th
                scan_input. If omitted, 0 will be used as the scan axis for every
                scan_input. Negative value for an axis means counting dimensions from
                the back. Accepted range is [-r, r-1] where r = rank(input).

            scan_input_directions: An optional list of M flags. The i-th element of the
                list specifies the direction to be scanned for the i-th scan_input
                tensor: 0 indicates forward direction and 1 indicates reverse direction.
                If omitted, all scan_input tensors will be scanned in the forward
                direction.

            scan_output_axes: An optional list of K flags. The i-th element of the list
                specifies the axis for the i-th scan_output. The scan outputs are
                accumulated along the specified axis. If omitted, 0 will be used as the
                scan axis for every scan_output. Negative value for an axis means
                counting dimensions from the back. Accepted range is [-r, r-1].

            scan_output_directions: An optional list of K flags, one for each
                scan_output. The i-th element of the list specifies whether the i-th

        Takes a tensor as input and outputs an 1D int64 tensor containing the shape of the input tensor.
        Optional attributes start and end can be used to compute a slice of the input tensor's shape.
        If start axis is omitted, the slice starts from axis 0.
        The end axis, if specified, is exclusive (and the returned value will not include the size of that axis).
        If the end axis is omitted, the axes upto the last one will be included.
        Negative axes indicate counting back from the last axis.
        Note that axes will be clamped to the range [0, r-1], where r is the
        rank of the input tensor if they are out-of-range (after adding r in the case of
        negative axis). Thus, specifying any end value > r is equivalent to specifying an end
        value of r, and specifying any start value < -r is equivalent to specifying a start
        value of 0.

        Examples:

        ::

            Input tensor with shape: [2, 3, 4]
            No attributes specified.

            Input tensor with shape: [2, 3, 4]
            start: -1
            Output: [4]



        ::

            Input tensor with shape: [2, 3, 4]
            end: -1
            Output: [2, 3]



        ::

            Input tensor with shape: [2, 3, 4]
            start: 1
            end: 2
            Output: [3]

            end: (Optional) Ending axis for slicing the shape. Negative value means
                counting dimensions from the back. If omitted, sizes of all axes upto
                (including) the last one will be included.

            start: (Optional) Starting axis for slicing the shape. Default value is
