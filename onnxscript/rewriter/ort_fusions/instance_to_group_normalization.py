    """Check if the simulated instance normalization is used.

    In torchlib with opset18, onnx.GroupNorm is using wrong definition, so
    we use InstanceNormalization to simulate GroupNormalization. We need to check if there are arguments created to simulation.
    If there are, then we need to replace the pattern. If they are not used, then we don't need to replace the pattern.

    To validate this, we need to check the following:
    1. weight_for_norm are all 1 and bias_for_norm are all 0, as they are created for the simulation.
    2. weight_full and bias_full are unsqueezed to be easily broadcastable.
    3. input rank should be 4
    4. weight_full and bias_full should have ones except first dim.
    5. adjusted_input_shape is a constant tensor of form [0, g, -1]
    6. original_input_shape is the same as input_x shape.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the simulated instance normalization is used, False otherwise.
