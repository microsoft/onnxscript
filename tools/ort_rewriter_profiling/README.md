## Workflow

### Setup Environment

1. Setup access to vm with GPU.
2. Install PyTorch, ONNX, ONNXScript, etc.
3. Build ONNXRuntime from source, with nvtx profiling enabled.
    ```
    # Under onnxruntime root folder
    ./build.sh --config RelWithDebInfo --parallel 0 --use_cuda --build_wheel --skip_tests --enable_nvtx_profile
    # After build complete
    pip install build/Linux/RelWithDebInfo/dist/onnxruntime_gpu-*.whl
    ```

### Model Optimization

1. Identify model with performance gap from torchbench dashboard.
2. Prepare ONNX model.
    <!-- - (Optional) Run torchbench locally to retrieve exported model.  -->
    - Download ONNX model from [benchmark pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/onnxconverter/ONNXConverter/_build?definitionId=7&_a=summary). Navigate to the latest run, and download selected models from the artifacts.
    - The models should be put under `onnx-script/tools/ort_rewrite_profiling/onnx_models/`. It is **important** to follow the exact folder format, since it is assumed by many analysis tools. It should look like:
        ```
        onnx-script/tools/ort_rewrite_profiling/onnx_models/<model_name>
        ├── dynamo
        │   ├── <model_name>_dynamo.onnx
        │   ├── test_data_set_0
        ├── torchscript
        │   ├── <model_name>_torchscript.onnx
        │   ├── test_data_set_0
        ```

3. Run optimization. Example command to apply optimizations on `stable_diffusion_unet` `dynamo` model and produces `dynamo_ort_rewritten` model under the same folder. `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is used to specify GPU device to avoid the device others are using.
    ```
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="3" python ort_rewrite.py  --model stable_diffusion_unet --model-dir ./onnx_models/ --log-level 20
    ```

4. Investigate the root cause of performance gap.
    - Run nsys profiling analysis for detailed performance per operator. For example:
        ```
        # Under onnx-script/tools
        CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="3" python nsys_profile.py --compiler torchscript --compiler dynamo_ort_rewritten --model-dir onnx_models/stable_diffusion_unet/ --iteration 20
        ```
        This script generates a sorted report of per operation performance. (WIP: more features to come including comparison table)
        ```

    - Run benchmark for high level performance metrics. For example:
        ```
        # Under onnx-script/tools
        CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="2" python bench_model.py --model-dir ./onnx_models/stable_diffusion_unet --device cuda -i 20 --compiler torchscript
        ```
        Or omit `--compiler` to run all compilers.
        ```
        # Under onnx-script/tools
        CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="2" python bench_model.py --model-dir ./onnx_models/stable_diffusion_unet --device cuda -i 20
        ```
    - Load and inspect model in Netron.
        - Load `dynamo` model to inspect exported structured graph (optimizer already included).
        - Load `dynamo_ort_rewritten` model to inspect inlined graph after onnxruntime rewriter.

5. Develop optimization code.
    - `onnx-script/onnxscript/optimizer`: Optimizations such as constant folding, inlining, dead code elimination etc.
    - `onnx-script/onnxscript/rewriter`: Pattern based fusions.
    - `onnx-script/onnxscript/rewriter/ort_fusions`: Onnxruntime specific pattern based fusions.

6. Repeat step 3 to step 5 to verify performance improvement as well as parity after new optimization.
