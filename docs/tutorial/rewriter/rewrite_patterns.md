# Introduction

The ONNX Rewriter tool provides the user with the functionality to replace certain patterns in an ONNX graph with another pattern based on rewrite rules provided by the user.

# Usage

There are three main components needed when rewriting patterns in the graph:

1. `target_pattern` : Original pattern to match against. This pattern is written as a function using ONNXScript-like operators.
2. `replacement_pattern` : Pattern to replace the original pattern with. This pattern is also written as a function using ONNXScript-like operators.
3. `match_condition` (optional) : Pattern rewrite will occur only if the match condition is satisfied.
