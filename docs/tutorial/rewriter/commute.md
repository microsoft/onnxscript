# Utilizing `commute` parameter for pattern-matching
Extending the previous [simple example](heading-target-simple), assumming a scenario where we have a graph with the following structure.

![commute](examples/img/erfgelu_03_commute.png){align=center width=500px}

In this graph, there exist two node pattern that constitute a `GELU` op. However, there is a subtle difference between the two. Focusing on the parent `Mul` nodes in either patterns, the order of the input values being multiplied is switched.

![gelu_pattern_1](examples/img/erfgelu_04_commute.png){width=330px align=left} ![gelu_pattern_2](examples/img/erfgelu_05_commute.png){width=330px align=center}


If we utilize the same `target_pattern` created for the earlier [simple example](heading-target-simple) (shown below), only one of two `GELU` pattern will be matched.

```{literalinclude} examples/erfgelu.py
:pyobject: erf_gelu_pattern
```

```{image} examples/img/erfgelu_06_commute.png
:alt: The resulting graph after matching.
:width: 400px
:align: center
```

Only one of the patterns has been successfully matched and replaced by a `GELU` node. In order to rewrite both the existing patterns in the graph, there are two methods.

(heading-target-commute-ruleset)=

## 1. Creating a rule-set with different patterns.

This method requires creating two separate rules and packing them into either a sequence of `PatternRewriteRule`s or a `RewriteRuleSet`. Creating a `RewriteRuleSet` is the preferable option but either can be used. In order to create a `RewriteRuleSet` with multiple rules `rule1` and `rule2` for example:

```python
from onnxscript.rewriter import pattern
rewrite_rule_set = pattern.RewriteRuleSet(rules=[rule1, rule2])
```

In order to apply this method to the example above, first create the two separate target patterns as follows:

```{literalinclude} examples/erfgelu.py
:pyobject: erf_gelu_pattern
```
```{literalinclude} examples/erfgelu.py
:pyobject: erf_gelu_pattern_2
```

:::{note}
:name: rule-application-order-matters

When you pass multiple rules in `pattern_rewrite_rules`, the **order in which they appear is important**.
This is because some rules may depend on patterns created or modified by earlier rules. For example, if `rule2` can only match after `rule1` has made a specific change in the model, then `rule1` must come **before** `rule2` in the list.
If you're not seeing expected results, try adjusting the order or applying the rule set in a loop until no more changes occur.
:::


Then, create two separate `PatternRewriteRule`s, one for each target pattern. Pack these rules into a `RewriteRuleSet` object and apply rewrites by passing the created `RewriteRuleSet` for the `pattern_rewrite_rules` parameter.

```{literalinclude} examples/erfgelu.py
:pyobject: apply_rewrite_with_ruleset
```

## 2. Using the `commute` parameter while creating a rule.

Creating multiple target patterns for similar patterns can be tedious. In order to avoid this, the `commute` parameter can be utilized while creating the `RewriteRuleSet`. Simply set `commute=True` in order to avoid creating multiple target pattern for cases where patterns are different due to commutativity. Multiple rules with the different patterns emerging due to satisfying the commutativity property are automatically packed into a `RewriteRuleSet` object. Then apply rewrites by passing the created `RewriteRuleSet` for the `pattern_rewrite_rules` parameter.

```{literalinclude} examples/erfgelu.py
:pyobject: apply_rewrite_with_commute
```

For the both of the aforementioned methods, the final graph with both rewrites applied should look as follows:

![commute](examples/img/erfgelu_07_commute.png){align=center width=300px}
